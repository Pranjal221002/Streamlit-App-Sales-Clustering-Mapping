# Streamlit-App-Sales-Clustering-Mapping
Built an interactive data analysis tool using Streamlit, Folium, and scikit-learn

Developed a Streamlit web application that performs K-Means clustering on restaurant sales data based on geographic coordinates and performance metrics.

Enabled dynamic user input for the number of clusters (1â€“10), and visualized the results on an interactive Folium map with color-coded cluster markers.

Engineered a data preprocessing pipeline to clean and format input CSVs, including handling of null values in categorical columns like "Cuisines".

Implemented automatic Excel report generation for clustered data, available for download within the app.

Leveraged Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Folium for data processing, clustering, and map rendering.
